<p style={{color:"#666",}}>Engineers Australia requires a technical report, CPD, from applicants who want to pursue an engineering profession in Australia. CPD 
stands for Continuing Professional Development. Engineers use CPD in Australia to assess the competency and education level of 
international engineering students and professionals who wish to work in the country. The primary purpose of the CPD is to demonstrate 
your professional abilities and knowledge as an engineering associate, professional engineer, or engineering technologist.
For permanent engineer migration to Australia, a CPD report is one of the most important documents. Australia provides an excellent 
environment for engineers to work. Before applying for a skilled immigration visa in Australia, you must get your CPD approved by EA. 
You can write this report independently or with the assistance of engineers. Engineers Australia has stated that CPD reports must follow 
their requirements and be free of mistakes.
